<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

This project is about building an application similar to Reddit (called Micro-Reddit) where a user can create a post and add comments to it. It is based mainly on the active record, models, and associations to the tests, meaning no user interface has been added.

### Built With
This project was built using these technologies.
* Ruby & Ruby on Rails
* SQLite
* Rubocop
* Stickler
* Atom :atom:

<!-- INSTALLATION -->
